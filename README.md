### To check the feasibility of our extension, we have changed our code to let TruthGuard to detect the "The" word. 
#### Changed part: 
####    Line 6: "Vaccine" to "The", treshold 2 to treshold 1
### With that, it will idnetify all the article with "The" word as fake news and direct us to a fact-checking website.
